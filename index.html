            <h2>How it works?</h2>

                <p>You and your team members can learn how to separate thinking into six clear functions and roles. Each thinking role is identified with a colored symbolic “thinking hat.” By mentally wearing and switching “hats,” you can easily focus or redirect thoughts, the conversation, or the meeting.</p>

            <div>

                <p>The White Hat calls for information known or needed. “The facts, just the facts.”</p>

                <p>The Yellow Hat symbolizes brightness and optimism. Under this hat you explore the positives and probe for value and benefit.</p>

                <p>Risks, difficulties, Problems – The risk management Hat, probably the most powerful Hat; a problem however if overused; spot difficulties where things might go wrong, why something may not work, inherently an action hat with the intent to point out issues of risk with intent to overcome them.</p>

                <p>The Red Hat signifies feelings, hunches and intuition. When using this hat you can express emotions and feelings and share fears, likes, dislikes, loves, and hates.</p>

                <p>The Green Hat focuses on creativity; the possibilities, alternatives, and new ideas. It’s an opportunity to express new concepts and new perceptions.</p>

                <p>The Blue Hat is used to manage the thinking process. It’s the control mechanism that ensures the Six Thinking Hats® guidelines are observed.</p>

            <header class="capitalize-style" id="a2">five whys</header>

                <p>The 5 Whys technique is one of the most effective tools for root cause analysis in the Lean management arsenal. Every team faces roadblocks in its daily work. However, using the 5 Whys will help you find the root cause of any problem and protect the process from recurring mistakes and failures.</p>

                <p>This is why finding and eliminating the root cause is crucial if you want to avoid iteration of failures.</p>

                <p>You can notice that the root cause of the initial problem turned out to be something completely different from most expectations.</p>

            <h2>Define the problem</h2>

                <p>Discuss the problem with the team and make a clear problem statement. It will help you define the scope of the issue you are going to investigate.</p>

            <h2>Ask Why</h2>

                <p>Keep in mind that “5” is just a number. Ask “Why” as many times as you need to complete the process and take appropriate actions.</p>

                <p>Empower one person to facilitate the whole process. This team leader will ask the questions and try to keep the team focused. The answers should be based on facts and real data, rather than on emotional opinions.</p>
                
                <p>The facilitator should ask “Why” as many times as needed until the team can identify the root cause of the initial problem.</p>

            <h2>Advices</h2>

            <code><div class="notes">

                <p>Don’t ask too many Whys. If you keep going, you may end up receiving tons of unreasonable suggestions and complaints, which is not the purpose. Focus on finding the root cause.</p>

                <p>Sometimes there could be more than one root cause. In these cases, the 5 Whys analysis will look more like a matrix with different branches. This may even help you detect and eliminate organizational issues that have permanent negative effects on the overall performance.</p>

                <p>SCAMPER refers to a series of thought sparkers or provocations which help you to innovate on an existing product, service or situation by looking through different lenses. There are seven provocation lenses in the SCAMPER method:</p>

            <div id="scamper-contraction">

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>S</strong>ubstitute</li>

                    <li><strong>C</strong>ombine</li>

                    <li><strong>A</strong>adapt</li>

                    <li><strong>M</strong>odify</li>

                    <li><strong>P</strong>ut to another use</li>

                    <li><strong>E</strong>liminate</li>

                    <li><strong>R</strong>earrange</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <h2>How to Use SCAMPER</h2>

                <p><strong>Substitute</strong>  -  Overall, the question to think about here is this: What can I substitute or change in my product, problem or process? You should think about substituting part(s) of your product or process for something else.</p>

                <p><strong>Combine</strong>  -  The overall question to think about here is: How can I combine two or more parts of my product, problem, or process so as to achieve a different product, problem, or process to enhance synergy? Creative thinking involves combining previously unrelated ideas, products, or services in order to create something new and innovative.</p>

                <p><strong>Adapt</strong>  -  Overall, the question you need to think about is: What can I adapt in my product, problem, or process? Think about which parts of the product or process you could adapt so as to solve your problem.</p>

                <p><strong>Modify</strong> (Also Magnify and Minify)  -  The question you need to focus on is this: What can I modify or put more or less emphasis on in my product, problem, or process? Can I change the item in some way? Can I change meaning, colour, motion, sound, smell, form, or shape? It’s time to magnify or exaggerate your idea, product, problem, or process—or to minify it. These questions will give you new insights about which components are the most important ones. Think about changing part or all of the current situation or product. Alternatively, distort the product in an unusual way.</p>

                <p><strong>Put to Another Use</strong>  -  The overall question to consider here is this: How can I put the thing to other uses? What are new ways to use the product or service? Can I reach out to other users if I modify the product? Is there another market for the product? It’s time to work out how you may be able to put your current product or idea to other uses and purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>Eliminate</strong>  -  Your overall question to consider here is: What can I eliminate or simplify in my product, design, or service? Think of what might happen if you were to eliminate, simplify, reduce, or minimise parts of your idea. If you continue to trim your idea, service, or process—you can gradually narrow your challenge down to that part or function that is most important.</p>

            <p><strong>Rearrange</strong>  -  Overall, you have to ask yourself this question: How can I change, reorder, or reverse the product or problem? What would I do if I had to do this process in reverse?</p>

            <header class="capitalize-style" id="a3">creative problem solving</header>

            <p>Creative problem-solving primarily operates in the ideate phase of design thinking but can be applied to others. This is because design thinking is an iterative process that moves between the stages as ideas are generated and pursued. This is normal and encouraged, as innovation requires exploring multiple ideas.</p>

            <h2>The four stages are:</h2>

                <p><strong>Clarify</strong>  -  The clarification stage allows you to empathize with the user and identify problems. Observations and insights are informed by thorough research. Findings are then reframed as problem statements or questions.</p>

                <p><strong>Ideate</strong>  -  Ideation is the process of coming up with innovative ideas. The divergence of ideas involved with creative problem-solving is a major focus.</p>

                <p><strong>Develop</strong>  -  In the development stage, ideas evolve into experiments and tests. Ideas converge and are explored through prototyping and open critique.</p>

                <p><strong>Implement</strong>  -  Implementation involves continuing to test and experiment to refine the solution and encourage its adoption.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Define the Problem</h2>

                <p>Start by clearly defining the problem you are trying to address using your fishbone diagram. It could be a quality issue, employee dissatisfaction, or any other issue that you want to understand and improve. You can use paper checklists or spreadsheets to define the problems or use specific tools such as SafetyCulture (formerly iAuditor) to capture and organize your specified issues.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Decide on Key Categories of Causes</h2>

                <p>Sorting potential causes into different categories makes it easier to identify root causes later on. You can use the 6Ms as a starting point to help you decide on key types.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Identify Possible Causes within Each Category</h2>

                <p>Once you have decided on your key categories, you can begin brainstorming possible causes for each one. Consider all of the factors that could affect your process or product and note them down as potential causes. Below is an example of possible causes in each category using the 6Ms (Material, Method, Machine, Measurement, Manpower, and Mother Nature).</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Sort and Prioritize Potential Causes</h2>

                <p>Once you have a list of possible causes, it is helpful to sort and prioritize them based on their likelihood of being root causes. It will help you focus your efforts on the most likely reasons. There are a few different quality management tools you can use to sort and prioritize potential causes; some of these include:</p>

            <code><div class="notes">
            
                <p>The 5 Whys: This technique can be used to drill down to the root cause by asking “why” five times.</p>

                <p>Pareto Analysis: This technique can help you prioritize potential causes by identifying the most common ones.</p>

                <p>Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA): This risk analysis tool can help you prioritize possible causes based on their potential impact.</p>
            
            </div></code>

            <h2>Step 5: Test Potential Causes</h2>

                <p>After you have sorted and prioritized your potential causes, it is time to start testing them to see if they are root causes. Trying to find out what might be the possible causes can be done in several ways:</p>

                <code><div class="notes">
                
                    <p>Option A: Process Map - Branching out from the main problem, you can create a process map to test different potential causes. Using a process map, you can identify the gaps in your system that may lead to your problem’s root cause.</p>
                
                </div></code> 
                
                <code><div class="notes"> 
                
                    <p>Option B: Brainstorming - You can also use brainstorming techniques to identify potential solutions that could address the root cause of your problem. It is an excellent way to get input from various team members and stakeholders.</p>
                
                </div></code>

        </section>

            <header class="uppercase-style" id="a6">doit</header>
            
            <h2>Define Problem</h2>

            <p>Analysing the problem to ensure that the correct question is being asked. The following points may help to do this:</p>

            <code><div class="notes">
            
                <p>Check that you are tackling the problem, not the symptoms of the problem. To do this, ask yourself why the problem exists repeatedly until you get to the root of it. (see 'Why?' etc. - repeatable questions)</p>

                <p>Lay out the bounds of the problem. Work out the objectives that you must achieve and the constraints that you are operating under.</p>
            
                <p>Where a problem appears to be very large, break it down into smaller parts. Keep on going until each part is achievable in its own right, or needs a precisely defined area of research to be carried out.</p>
            
            </div></code>

            <h2>Open Mind and Apply Creative Technique</h2>

                <p>Once you know the problem that you want to solve, you are ready to start generating possible solutions. It is very tempting just to accept the first good idea that you come across. If you do this, you will miss many even better solutions.</p>

                <p>At this stage of DO IT we are not interested in evaluating ideas - we are trying to generate as many different ideas as possible. Even bad ideas may be the seeds of good ones.</p>

                <p>You can use the whole range of creativity techniques covered on this site to obtain possible solutions.</p>

            <h2>Identify the Best Solution</h2>

                <p>Only at this stage do you select the best of the ideas you have generated. It may be that the best idea is obvious. Alternatively, it may be worth examining and developing a number of ideas in detail before you select one. You can use techniques such as ((Force-field analysis)).</p>

            <h2>Transform</h2>

                <p>Having identified the problem and created a solution to it, the final stage is to implement this solution. This involves not only development of a reliable product from your idea, but all the marketing and business side as well. This may take a great deal of time and energy.</p>

                <p>Many very creative people fail at this stage. They will have fun creating new products and services that may be years ahead of what is available on the market. They will then fail to develop them, and watch someone else make a fortune out of the idea several years later.</p>

            <h2>How the brain solves problems during sleep?</h2>

            <p>When you’re awake and trying to work through a sticky problem, the go-to approach is often taking a piece of paper and listing the pluses and minuses. But there are usually too many items, and you don’t know how to sufficiently rate the importance of each one, so "it doesn’t help you," Stickgold says.</p>

            <p>But when you get into bed, the brain does a triage and "rifles through the events of the day and sees what’s left unfinished," he says. It’s picking out what has some "affective buzz," the emotions that happened during or shortly after something took place. The brain uses these memory "tags" as indicators that the event was important and that there’s more to figure out. Essentially, the brain is saying, "I think I can help you."</p>

            <p>Two elements make this happen. The prefrontal cortex gets shut down. This part of the brain handles executive decision-making (which includes rational thinking and impulse control), but now there’s no critical edge or categories to put ideas in. The brain can freely associate and, as Stickgold says, "process in the background."</p>

            <p>And when you get into the REM stage of sleep, the neuromodulators norepinephrine and serotonin are turned off. Norepinephrine enhances focus on immediate, concrete problems. "It’s the reason you don’t want to hear about someone’s ‘brilliant idea’ when you’re approaching a deadline," he says.</p>
            
            <p>There’s little known about what happens when serotonin is shut off, but Stickgold suggests it biases the brain into identifying looser connections as valuable. With both neurochemicals at bay, fragments of ideas can come together. "You have enhanced discovery of weak associations, ones you’d never notice," Stickgold says.</p>
